    # The Basics {.chapter}

    ## Introduction

    This template is based on the `pagedown::html_paged` template and modified to meet the requirements of a generic thesis document. Standard RMarkdown formatting can be used for smooth and distraction free writting, for example I will add a citation for the {knitr} package which is located in the `Thesis.bib` file auto-generated in this template [@R-knitr].

    Thanks to the [help](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/issues/101) of [Romain Lesur](https://github.com/RLesur) this template has the ability to tag section headers with the word "Chapter ". To have your chapters display as this one (*Chapter 1 The Basics*) use the `{.chapter}` class like this:

    ***rmarkdown***

    ``` {.markdown}

    # The Basics {.chapter}

    ## Introduction

    This template is based on the `pagedown::html_paged` template...

## Second level heading

Here is some code and a plot, with a figure caption, Figure \@ref(fig:code):

```{r code, fig.cap='The automatic numbering of this figure will only work if it includes a figure caption, user beware!'}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length,
     iris$Sepal.Width,
     col = iris$Species,
     pch = 19)
```

Here is an example of an abbreviation where I use the `<abbr>` html tag <abbr title="Brent Thorne">BT</abbr>. In the future there may be a pandoc solution to abbreviation management, however <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the way to go for now.

# Understanding the method to the madness {.chapter}

Need formulas? Here's some `mathjax` notation:

$$
\beta = \sum^{1 - k}\frac{\delta D}{\sum\frac{\Delta \gamma A}{X-i}}
$$

## Adding Tables

You can easily add tables to this document like so, and you can also reference them like a figure, Table \@ref(tab:atable):

```{r atable}
knitr::kable(
  iris[1:4, 1:5],
  align = 'c',
  caption = 'A caption for the table.',
  col.names = c("Sepal L", "Sepal W", "Petal L", "Petal W", "Species")
)
```

# The final chapter to my pretend thesis {.chapter}

There are still a few features that would be nice to implement in the future for this template. For instance:

1.  It would be great to have the ability to use the [{redoc}](https://github.com/noamross/redoc) package to help those who have the ever dreaded "USE WORD ONLY" supervisors.

2.  It would also be great to have the ability to generate a *Reference* section for each *Chapter* for those who are writing in the "integrated article" format.

3.  Along with that, it would be great to pull the YAML data from a child .Rmd file and use it as a way to add the Chapter titles and any other subsequent information (for example a thesis chapter can often actually be a full manuscript and or published paper which would need to have all authors listed for that chapter specifically as well as the journal publication information/ citation data).

# References {.unnumbered}

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c('knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'xaringan'), 'packages.bib')
```

```{=html}
<!-- This '<div id="refs"></div>' needs to 
be here if you have appendix pages 
otherwise you can remove it.-->
```
::: {#refs}
:::

# APPENDIX I {.unnumbered}

```{r}
knitr::kable(iris[1:10,1:5], align = 'c')
```
